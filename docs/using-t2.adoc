At Stackable, we have a https://t2.stackable.tech/swagger-ui/[running instance of T2, window="_blank"] to provision our own clusters. As described in the link:../README.adoc[README], we use it for integration testing and troubleshooting and do not provide access publicly (except DIY, see below).

== Create a cluster

=== Create a cluster in T2's infrastructure

With request to https://t2.stackable.tech/swagger-ui/#/cluster-controller/createClusterUsingPOST[this endpoint, window="_blank"] you can create a new cluster. You have to provide the Stackable cluster definition as payload and a Token via the `t2-token` HTTP header to authenticate. The response is a description of the current cluster state.

To track the progress while the cluster is created, you can use https://t2.stackable.tech/swagger-ui/#/cluster-controller/getClusterUsingGET[this endpoint, window="_blank"]. The desired state you want to wait for is `RUNNING`. (requires token as well)

To see in more detail what T2 is doing to create your cluster, you can https://t2.stackable.tech/swagger-ui/#/cluster-controller/getLogUsingGET[trace the output log here, window="_blank"]. (requires token as well)

Once the cluster is up and running, you can download a script https://t2.stackable.tech/swagger-ui/#/cluster-controller/getClientScriptUsingGET[here, window="_blank"] which provides you with a convenient way to access the nodes of the cluster (see <<client_script>> below).

To check which versions of the Stackable components (agent, operators) are running in your cluster, you can get an overview https://t2.stackable.tech/swagger-ui/#/cluster-controller/getLogUsingGET[here, window="_blank"]. (requires token as well)

==== VPN (Wireguard)

A very convenient way to work with a running cluster is to put your machine in the provided VPN. Using http://t2.stackable.tech/swagger-ui/#/cluster-controller/getWireguardConfigUsingGET[this endpoint, window="_blank"] you can download a Wireguard config file which is ready to be used. Please refer to the Wireguard docs for your system to find out how to use this.

Once you are in the same network with the cluster, you can http://t2.stackable.tech/swagger-ui/#/cluster-controller/getKubeconfigUsingGET[download a kubeconfig file, window="_blank"] to interact with the Kubernetes system via *kubectl*, *k9s* or the like.



=== Create a cluster in your infrastructure

To create a cluster yourself, we offer what we call the *DIY option*. To use it, you can use https://t2.stackable.tech/swagger-ui/#/diy-cluster-controller/createClusterUsingGET[this service]. You have to provide a Stackable cluster definition as request body and get a ZIP file in return. This ZIP file comes with a `readme.txt` which explains the usage.


[[client_script]]
== The Stackable client script

This script can be used to access a running cluster conveniently. 

The script expects the private SSH key (matching one of the public keys in the Stackable cluster definition, see <<yaml>>) to be in your keystore (`~/.ssh/` in Linux). If you keep it at another location, you can provide the path to the private key with the `-i` option.

To ssh into a host, just provide the hostname as the single parameter, e.g.

[source,bash]
----
./stackable.sh worker-12
----

or, with path to key: 

[source,bash]
----
./stackable.sh worker-12 -i path/to/my/key
----

If you want to execute a command on the host, you can add it as a second param, e.g.

[source,bash]
----
./stackable.sh worker-12 "kubectl get nodes"
----

or, with path to key:

[source,bash]
----
./stackable.sh worker-12 -i path/to/my/key "kubectl get nodes"
----

[[yaml]]
== The Stackable cluster definition YAML

In either way you choose to use T2, you have to provide a definition of the Stackable cluster you want to create. You do this in a single YAML file. As of now, this Stackable cluster definition format is work in progress and the only documentation is the following example and the following table:

[source,yaml]

== The T2 client script

If you want to automate your Stackable cluster generation (e.g. in a CI/CD pipeline), you can use a https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stackabletech/t2/client-script/client/t2.py[Python script^] that we provide with T2. This section describes the usage of this script.

=== How the script works

Roughly, this is what the script does:

* Launch
** Create a folder `.cluster/` where the temporary files go
** Generate an SSH keypair
** Make a copy of your provided cluster definition file and add the public key to the `publicKeys` section. (If you do not plan to provide any SSH key on your own, please provide that section as an empty list!)
** Call T2 to launch a new cluster
** Wait until the cluster is up and running
** Download the Stackable client script (see <<client_script>>) into your current folder to easily access the built cluster.
* Terminate
** Call T2 to tear the cluster down
** Wait until the cluster is terminated

=== The launch command

The `launch` command needs as params:

. the T2 token to authenticate
. the base URL of the T2 REST API
. the path to a valid cluster definition file

Example:

[source,bash]
----
python3 t2.py launch my-secret-token https://t2.stackable.tech path/to/my/cluster.yaml
----


=== The terminate command

The `terminate` command needs as params:

. the T2 token to authenticate
. the base URL of the T2 REST API

Example:

[source,bash]
----
python3 t2.py terminate my-secret-token https://t2.stackable.tech 
----

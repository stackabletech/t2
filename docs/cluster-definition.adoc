You have to provide a definition of the Stackable cluster you want to create. You do this in a YAML file. This document describes the cluster definition.

== Overall structure

The T2 cluster definition is similar to a Kubernetes resource definition and consists of the header with the `apiVersion`, the `kind` of resource and the `metadata`. Following the header, you have to define the cluster's details in a `spec` section.

We chose the Kubernetes resource definition style to have a smoother migration path once we might decide to manage T2 clusters as Kubernetes resources. Furthermore, it's a well-known format.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: t2.stackable.tech/v2
kind: StackableT2Cluster
metadata: 
  name: for-future-use
  labels:
    label-1: value-1
    label-2: value-2
spec:
  ...
----

== Header (`apiVersion`, `kind` and `metadata`)

[options="header", cols="1,1,2,3"]
|=======
|key | type | rules | description
|apiVersion | `string` | *mandatory*, must be `t2.stackable.tech/v2` | API version like in Kubernetes
|kind | `string` | *mandatory*, must be `StackableT2Cluster` | Kind of resource like in Kubernetes
|metadata.name | `string` | *optional* | Name of the cluster. This name is currently not used, but may become important once we switch T2 to a Kubernetes application.
|metadata.labels | `map(string->string)` | *optional* | Labels for the cluster. These labels are used for the infrastructure components in the cloud vendors where possible. 
|=======


== Templates (selected in `spec.template` field)

The most important choice you have to make in a cluster definition is the `template` in the `spec` section. There are two kinds of templates: 

* "K3s-based self-provisioned": We use the compute power of a cloud provider and install a K3s-based Kubernetes cluster ourselves.
* "Managed K8s": We use the managed Kubernetes products of a cloud provider.

The following table lists the currently available templates:

[options="header"]
|=======
|Type|key |Cloud provider| Linux distribution
.9+|K3s |ionos-rocky-8 | IONOS Cloud | Rocky Linux 8
|ionos-debian-10 | IONOS Cloud | Debian 10
|ionos-debian-11 | IONOS Cloud | Debian 11
|aws-centos-8ยน | Amazon EC2 | CentOS 8
|hcloud-centos-8 | Hetzner Cloud | CentOS 8
|hcloud-centos-9 | Hetzner Cloud | CentOS 9
|hcloud-debian-10 | Hetzner Cloud | Debian 10
|hcloud-debian-11 | Hetzner Cloud | Debian 11
|pluscloud-open-centos-8ยน | PlusCloud Open (Plusserver, SCS implementation, based on OpenStack) | CentOS 8
.4+|managed K8s |azure-aks | Microsoft Azure | 
|aws-eks | Amazon AWS | 
|ionos-k8s | IONOS Cloud |
|gke | Google Kubernetes Engine |
|=======

== Specification of the cluster (`spec` section)

The content of the `spec` section differs depending on the cloud provider and template, so they are described separately in this document.

=== K3s on IONOS Cloud

[options="header", cols="3,1,2,5"]
|=======
|key | type | rules | description
|template | `string` | *mandatory*, one of `ionos-rocky-8`, `ionos-debian-10`, `ionos-debian-11` |

It has reasonable defaults, but you can overwrite them with the config properties in this section. Be cautious not to configure an orchestrator which has too little power. See following entries for details.

See https://update.k3s.io/v1-release/channels[here, window="_blank"] to inspect which versions are available.
| stackableVersions | `map` | *optional* | Map of versions of the Stackable operators to be used in this cluster. See below for a list of Stackable components as well as the version literals you can use.

== Stackable operators (section `spec.stackableVersions`)

These are operators that Stackable currently provides. You can specify their versions with the `spec.stackableVersions` section in the cluster definition (see above).

=== Version literals

As shown in various examples in this document, you can specify the versions of the Stackable components in the `spec.stackableVersions` section. The following table shows the different ways to do so by example:

[options="header"]
|=======
|example |description
|`RELEASE` | The newest release version which can be found in the Stackable repository
| (no version specified) | same as `RELEASE`
|`DEV` | The dev version `0.0.0-dev`
|`NONE` | The operator is not installed at all.
|`0.2.0-pr404` | latest build of version 0.2.0 from GitHub Pull Request #404
|`0.6.1` | realeased version 0.6.1
|=======

=== Default version for all Stackable Operators

To specify a version for *all* Stackable operators which are not explicitly mentioned in the Versions section, you can use the key `_-operator`. Using this operator most probably does not make sense with actual version numbers, but merely the keywords `RELEASE`, `DEV` or `NONE`.

If you'd like a cluster without any operators, you can set the version of `_-operator` to `NONE` as the only entry in the `versions` section.


== Service definitions

The service definitions depend on the used services. Please refer to the documentation of the operator for the product. You find the links to the components in the table above.

== Running T2

You can run T2 on premise if you like, but currently, we haven't put too much effort into making it conveniently reusable but merely built it to fit our very own needs. Nevertheless, this section might help if you want to run T2.

T2 is a Spring Boot application and can be packaged via Maven:

[source,bash]
----
mvn clean package
----

The resulting file `target/t2-server.jar` can be executed via Java:

[source,bash]
----
java -jar target/t2-server.jar [options]
----

The `options` are given in the form `--key1=value1 --key2=value2`. The option keys are described below.

=== Config options

The following table describes the config options of T2:

[options="header"]
|=======
|key |description |default value
|server.port |port of the HTTP server |`8080`
|t2.workspace.directory |directory where T2 stores the working dirs of the clusters |`/tmp/t2-workspace/`
|t2.templates.directory |directory where the T2 cluster templates are located |`./templates`
|t2.security.token.source |Source of the access token to secure T2. `file` means the token is stored in a file, `static` means it is provided as a property |`static`
|t2.security.token.file |location of the token file (see above) |`null`
|t2.security.token.static |security token (see above) |`t2-secret-token`
|t2.credential-file |File containing credentials in property format, e.g. `ionos_username` or `ionos_password` |`~/t2-credentials.properties`
|t2.dns.enabled |Should T2 create a DNS entry for the created cluster? Practically, this feature is not usable without our DNS provider account, so you should set it to `false` ;-) |`true`
|=======

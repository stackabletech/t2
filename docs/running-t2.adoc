== Running T2

To run T2, you can use the Docker image `docker.stackable.tech/t2:latest` (or another version you find https://repo.stackable.tech/#browse/search/docker=attributes.docker.imageName%3Dt2[here, window="_blank"])

T2 is a dockerized Spring Boot application and can be packaged/built via Maven:

[source,bash]
----
mvn clean package
----

You can start a container based on the resulting Docker image and configure it with port mappings and volume mounts as described below:

=== Config options

[options="header"]
|=======
|option |description | usage
| port mapping| make T2 reachable on your machine | map a host port to container port `8080`
| credential file | file containing credentials in property format, e.g. `ionos_username = me`, `ionos_password = youguess` | map your file to `/var/t2/credentials.properties`
| security token file | file containing (only!) the token that must be used to access T2 | map your file to `/var/t2/security-token`
| workspace directory | directory where T2 stores the working dirs of the clusters | Map your folder to `/var/t2/workspace`. If you omit the mapping, the workspace is inside the container and therefore ephemeral.
|=======
